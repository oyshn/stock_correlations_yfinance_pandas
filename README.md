An exercise to find correlations for stock prices with Yahoo Finance 

This task is provided as a part of Tomi Mester's data36 Data Science courses and hobby projects (which are excellent!).

The task (roughly as it appears on Tomi's website, yet, I am omitting things one must be a course participant to see) is to download the historical price data of these 16 financial assets (or any other assets of one's choosing) from Yahoo Finance :

Tesla stock (ticker symbol: TSLA)
Nio stock (ticker symbol: NIO)
Clean Energy ETF (ticker symbol: IQQH.F)
Bitcoin (ticker symbol: BTC-USD)
Ethereum (ticker symbol: ETH-USD)
Litecoin (ticker symbol: LTC-USD)
Amazon (ticker symbol: AMZN)
Twitter (ticker symbol: TWTR)
Facebook (ticker symbol: FB)
Square (ticker symbol: SQ)
Paypal (ticker symbol: PYPL)
Berkshire Hathaway (ticker symbol: BRK-A)
S&P 500 ETF (ticker symbol: CSPX.AS)
Gold (ticker symbol: GC=F)
Silver (ticker symbol: SI=F)
Crude Oil (ticker symbol: CL=F)
Under Armour (ticker symbol: UA)
Gartner (ticker symbol: IT)

Then, we have to run correlation analyses -- and find highly correlated assets in the above list. We assume that we can buy only 4 out of these stocks, and we should select the ones that would result in the most diverse portfolio based on our analysis.

As a bonus task, we assume that we put $100 in each of the 4 assets we picked on 2024-07-01. We have to plot the value of the portfolio over time.

Kudos to Tomi for the great task!
